Created a new scripts folder for python.
It will hold finalized scripts, and scripts that are being currently used.

--snip--

The py_git_commit.py is used to standardize the commit messages seen on github (and elsewhwere).

It's to be renamed to com and placed on the PATH.
Alternatively, this scripts folder should be put on the path - but that has the consequence of having all scripts belong to PATH. Which might not be ideal.

Idealy, we standardize the folder holding all runnable scripts.
