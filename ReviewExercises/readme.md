This folder will hold very simple Python exercises. The idea is to get back on track with Python - after having studied a lot of other techs, and having stayed away from any meaningful Python work for the past year. Since I might need it once again on a professional basis (and some Bash wouldn't hurt either)... this folder is born. You have been warned: these are very simple exercises.

By the way, doesn't matter all too much where I'm taking these exercises from, but here it goes:

Let's add some information on the enumerate() function, which I haven't seen in a while.

This function will iterate over a sequence (such as a list) while keeping track of the index of each item - pretty useful.

It's, in fact, returning pairs of index+item tuples.

We can see this in the line:

for i, char in enumerate(first_list): 

The tuple is the (i, char) pair, ofc.

Move along. Nothing to see here.
