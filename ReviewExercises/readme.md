This folder will hold very simple Python exercises. The idea is to get back on track with Python - after having studied a lot of other techs, and having stayed away from any meaningful Python work for the past year. Since I might need it once again on a professional basis (and some Bash wouldn't hurt either)... this folder is born. You have been warned: these are very simple exercises.

By the way, doesn't matter all too much where I'm taking these exercises from, but here it goes:
