This folder holds scripts that are yet to be placed elsewhere.

Created a py_git_script.py to try and standardize my git commits.

Still have to tinker a bit with it.
Currently, the type of issue is appearing first and the rest is coming up as description of the commit.

It might be more interesting to have the actualy action decribed first, and the type of fix + objectives to appear afterwards as a description

-> Alternatively, can the whole thing come up without a description field?

-> Ideally, the commit will have the name of the file as well, no? (is this necessary?)

Adding here stuff from The Big Book of Small Python Projects, to get some practice back in my system, and hopefully give me some ideas on stuff to do.
