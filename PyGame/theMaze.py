''' I'm starting afresh my maze game project
    The idea is to have a system that creates mazes
    and another one that lets the user traverse those locations
    Then I might want to add perhaps an AI generative element
    to the maze creation, game elements, etc.

# Rules for creation:
# - if diagonal has empty space, this must be filled (or we're in a room - rooms later)
# - rooms are created beforehand in separate function.
# - maze adds rooms (x for a n times m maze), then the corridors get added
# - If two big enough rooms in straight line we can have double corridors
# - rather have a dungeon than a maze (maze-ey dungeon)
# - if big enough map, small change entry point or exit point is double door
# - when rooms added, move on to create hallways
# - on rooms. How much room a romm does take? Conside this in calculations.
