# In this folder I'll keep some general and introductory information on APIs.

An API is basically a set of rules and protocols that allow for different software applications to communicate and interact with each other.

APIs serve as intermediaries between servers and clients, by facilitating communication, allowing for a seamless integration between systems.

To work with APIs in Python, we need certain tools, like requests.

. pip3 install requests

This is then imported into our code through a library

import requests
