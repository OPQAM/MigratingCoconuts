# README

This folder is just the result of realizing of how important Python is within my present context.

I've studied it some years ago, and have rarely used it in the past (mostly some simple automation tools and scripts). That needs to change.

So, I'll run through a series of **very** simple exercises that will get more and more complex. The idea is to do these, if possible, on a weekly or (ideally) daily basis.

TL;DR: this is all basic, simple and uninteresting. Move along.
