Project:

Open bmp file, do stenogaphy on it, close.
Be able to check any bmp file for messages.

bmp and not jpeg, for instance, to avoid compressed files.

the metadata we can gather will allow us to create an amateur program for steno.
Writing and reading - without damaging the file. :)

NOTE(!): This simple .py will not account for comments in the .ppm or other schenanigans! AKA: it's one step away from not working. You have been warned.
