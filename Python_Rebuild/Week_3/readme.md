Idea:

Simple week project for steganography.

The steganographer will write a hidden message on a .ppm file.
The extractor will read any .ppm file and check the least significant bits, for any hidden message.

NOTE: this is a very simple script that will fail under many circumstances. For example, if you have a .ppm file with a comment in the header, it will break the steganographer.

You have been warned. This is a proof of concept still, not a full blown tool. It will likely never become a full blown tool, as I am quite sure there are many of those out there, besides... I'm not a programmer.
