# Readme for Day 002

## Goals for Today

- Continue to read the docs and do some simple tests.  
- Make sure pyelftools is properly installed and I can run it flawlessly.  
- See what info I can get from raw output.  

## Progress Update

- Created a virtual environment to isolate dependencies and ensure a clean environment for my Python scripts.  
- Tested a couple simple scripts with pyelftools to extract information from an ELF file I created.  
- All files will always be included inside its respective [day](https://github.com/OPQAM/MigratingCoconuts/tree/master/One_hundred_project/Days/Day_002).
